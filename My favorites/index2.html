        <h2>10. Avalanche</h2>
        <p>Fun fact: This is the oldest track on this list, being from the 2016 EP “Virtualism”. Despite its noticable age, it's probably the best track from its era. It hits me in the feels with melancholic melodies and its unique composition.</p>

        <h2>9. Prophecy</h2>
        <p>This is the most recent work of Creo, Prophecy. It's short and sweet, to say the least. If it was longer it could've maybe placed a bit higher. This track is a great experience. It manages to give me feelings of hopelessness and determination at the same time.</p>

        <h2>8. Glome</h2>
        <p>This track is just awesome. Not much to say. It gives me nostalgic, positive vibes. It sounds like a sunny day at the beach before the pandemic. I really dig it, simple as that.</p>

        <h2>7. In synergy</h2>
        <p>This is like Glome on steroids. This is super mega ultra nostalgic. It sounds like a preschool field trip out in the woods in early May. That, alongside melodies that give you an experience of serenity and tranquility. This is definitely emphasized when the saxophone comes in near the end.</p>
