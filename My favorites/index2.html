        <h2>15. Avalanche</h2>
        <p>Fun fact: This is the oldest track on this list, being from the 2016 EP “Virtualism”. Despite its noticable age, it's probably the best track from its era. It hits me in the feels with melancholic melodies and its unique composition.</p>

        <h2>14. Atmosphere</h2>
        <p>One of Creo's attempts at being a bit more mainstream, which essentially means adding lyrics. Verses and choruses. I have no idea what the lyrics in this one means, but they go hard nonetheless. Musically, it's really neat. Amazing progression, with the two drops being very distinct from one another. The second one hits like a train, because it's almost an entirely new melody playing 3 minutes into the song.</p>

        <h2>13. Crystallize</h2>
        <p>This one sounds a little mysterious. But not the spooky halloween kind of mysterious, more like the dark and gloomy kind of mysterious. It's flawless from start to finish, has great iconic melodies that never get old. </p>

        <h2>12. Flow</h2>
        <p>It lives up to the name. Probably some of the best saxophone music from Creo, and Creo is renowned for the sax. It just sounds so smooth, but switches it up a little near the halfway point and oh is it good. I love the ending too, very clever use of crossfading.</p>

        <h2>11. Prophecy</h2>
        <p>This is the most recent work of Creo, Prophecy. It's short and sweet, to say the least. If it was longer it could've maybe placed a bit higher. This track is a great experience. It manages to give me feelings of hopelessness and determination at the same time.</p>

        <h2>10. Glome</h2>
        <p>This track is just awesome. Not much to say. It gives me nostalgic, positive vibes. It sounds like a sunny day at the beach before the pandemic. I really dig it, simple as that.</p>

        <h2>9. Aurora</h2>
        <p>This is so fun to listen to, despite not having any happy vibes to it. Great piano melodies and synths and additional sounds that mesh together into this beautiful experience.</p>

    <div class="n8">
        <h2>8. In Synergy</h2>
        <p>This is like Glome on steroids. This is super mega ultra nostalgic. It sounds like a preschool field trip out in the woods in early May. That, alongside melodies that give you an experience of serenity and tranquility. This is definitely emphasized when the saxophone comes in near the end.</p>

        <h2>7. Gravitate</h2>
        <p>THE guitar song. Creo popped off on the guitars here, no doubt about it. Musically it's SO simple, yet so effective. For a lot of the song theres literally only two notes being played repeatedly, but it still works. It has a really impactful ending aswell. </p>

        <h2>6. Aura</h2>
        <p>This track has so much aura. Jokes aside, it's terrific. This makes me feel like im swimming with the dolphins or some shit. It's an out of body experience, my soul leaves my body.</p>

        <h2>5. Idolize</h2>
        <p>Insanely well composed. Absolute ear candy. Everything from the low humming to the loud synths work together so well, like they were made for eachother. The leadup to the second drop builds up the tension super well. The whole piece has this ethereal feel to it, and it's just amazing.</p>

        <h2>4. We Can Dream</h2>
        <p>Creo doesn't usually make DnB (Drum and Bass) music. So this track renders me dumbfounded at how good it is. This was my favorite track for a while. It makes me feel like im levitating, far above the clouds. It sounds like a dream, hence the name.   </p>

        <h2>3. Shine</h2>
        <p>This track is just really cool. It's not something you'd usually hear from Creo, but as we know he never dissapoints when he tries new stuff. This sounds like a mix between Dnb and Jazz, which sounds horrendous on paper but give this a few listens and it will have grown on you in no time. Great progression as always, with the crescendo at the end being a nice touch. </p>

        <h2>2. Red Haze</h2>
        <p>One word to describe this: Euphoric. The second drop is out of this world. It mixes brass and string instruments super well, conveying emotions I didn't know I had troughout the entire duration of the piece.  </p>

        <h2>1. Sky and Soul</h2>
        <p>I love everything about this. It goes to so many different places, each sounding unique and high quality. It is widely considered to be Creo's best work of all time, and it shows. The best part has to be the last minute and a half or so. Some of the most soothing and spiritual shit i've ever heard in my life. It really puts the "Soul" in "Sky and Soul". </p>
