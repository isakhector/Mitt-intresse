            <h1>About Creo</h1>
            <p>Creo (Clemens Michael Höberth) is an independent electronic music producer from Austria. He makes music that has similarities to EDM and other genres. He combines unusual aspects like melodies, instruments and arrangements together to fuse into refreshingly unique tracks.</p>

        <h1>Creo's career</h1>
        <p>He's been making music for over 16 years, but only in 2015 did he start taking it seriously. The major breakthrough in his career was in 2016, when he released “Dimension”. But why is Dimension so significant? Creo started uploading his songs to the audio portal on the website “Newgrounds”. If you didn’t know, Newgrounds has a system that allows audio to be used externally in other games, and Creo enabled this option. The most popular game with this feature is “Geometry Dash”, and in this game a player named “KrmaL”, created a level called “Black Blizzard” using Dimension as the song. It went viral within the game’s community and through this level, Creo was able to make a name for himself.</p>
        <p>Creo has since then kept pumping out music, steadily improving with every song through the will of trying new stuff. Currently, he is looking to go more mainstream in the future, escaping the small indie EDM bubble. </p>

        <h1>Fun facts</h1>
        <p>Creo does many other things on the side. He's not just a music producer, he also does game development and VFX and other digital artwork. He actually makes his own cover art and animations for all of his songs! </p>
        <p>Speaking of cover art and animations, he seems to have a weird obsession with circles. It's an ongoing theme in his art, the center of attention in his work is almost always some kind of circle, sometimes it's even in the name of the song. Sometimes incredibly obvious, like with "In Circles" or "Sphere". Other than just circles, he's really fond of mountains and landscapes. </p>
        <p>He started taking music seriously in 2015. But his first song was made way back in 2009, 16 years ago. It was called "Live".</p>
        <p>He has another alias for platforms where the name "Creo" is already taken. In those cases, he goes by "Hyperdemented". Alot of his old songs on Newgrounds are uploaded under this name.</p>
        <p>Creo live records his guitars! And as a result of this some songs are more fun to make than others. In a comment on Youtube, someone asked him what song he had the most fun making, and he didn't hesitate to answer with "Gravitate". </p>
