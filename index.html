        <h1>Creo's career</h1>
        <p>He's been making music for over 14 years, but only in 2015 did he start taking it seriously. The major breakthrough in his career was in 2016, when he released “Dimension”. But why is Dimension so significant? Creo started uploading his songs to the audio portal on the website “Newgrounds”. If you didn’t know, Newgrounds has a system that allows audio to be used externally in other games, and Creo enabled this option. The most popular game with this feature is “Geometry Dash”, and in this game a player named “KrmaL”, created a level called “Black Blizzard” using Dimension as the song. It went viral within the game’s community and through this level, Creo was able to make a name for himself.</p>
